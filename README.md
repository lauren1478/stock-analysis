# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance


## Overview of Project
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve refactor the existing code base to determine if the script ran more efficiently than the previous code, all while preserving the outcome of the data. The specifc data we are looking at is stock tickers, returns, and trading volume from specific years and we are helping Steve sort through this large dataset using the most efficient code.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
